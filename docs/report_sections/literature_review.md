# 2. Literature Review / Related Work

Career-focused networks like LinkedIn provide broad reach but lack institution-specific verification and admin-managed workflows. Proprietary alumni portals provide some verification, but are often closed-source and expensive.

CareerNest positions itself between general-purpose professional networks and proprietary alumni systems by offering:
- Private, college-scoped job boards and feeds.
- Role-aware onboarding and verification (HOD approvals, College Admin onboarding).
- Open-source, deployable stack enabling colleges to self-host or use managed services.

Relevant references and docs:
- Next.js docs — for routing and rendering strategies used in the client.
- Node.js + Express docs — for the REST API.
- PostgreSQL documentation — for schema and query optimizations.
- Cloudinary / AWS docs — for file uploads and storage.
