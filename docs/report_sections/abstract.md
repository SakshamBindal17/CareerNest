# Abstract

CareerNest is a university-focused professional networking platform that connects students, alumni, faculty and college administrators within a private, verified community. This project implements a full-stack solution using Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend and Node.js + Express with PostgreSQL for the backend. Key features include role-based authentication, OTP verification, college onboarding, alumni verification workflows (HOD approval), a college-specific job board, social feed (posts, comments, reactions), and private messaging.

The implementation emphasizes secure verification (official email domains, document uploads for alumni), modular architecture (separate client and server), and extensible storage via Cloudinary (with optional S3 support). The report includes system design diagrams, ER schema, API reference, testing notes, deployment instructions and a demo guide that together allow evaluators to run and assess the application locally or on hosted infrastructure.
