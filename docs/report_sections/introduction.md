# 1. Introduction

## Background and Motivation
Higher-education students and alumni often need a trusted, institution-specific channel to discover jobs, internships, mentorships and campus-specific announcements. Public professional networks mix members from all institutions and can dilute discovery and verification.

CareerNest addresses this by providing a private, verified community for colleges where roles and workflows (HOD approvals, College Admin onboarding) are first-class citizens.

## Problem Statement
Existing platforms lack institution-level verification and role-based admin flows tailored to colleges. CareerNest provides verified onboarding, alumni document verification, college-specific job boards and admin dashboards to reduce noise and improve trust.

## Objectives
- Implement secure sign-up and OTP verification flows.
- Create role-based dashboards for College Admins and HODs.
- Provide a moderated job board scoped to each college.
- Deliver a maintainable codebase using modern tooling.

## Scope and Limitations
Scope: features implemented in this repository include auth, onboarding flows, alumni verification, posts and a job board, messaging, and admin dashboards. Limitations: production-grade hardening (WAF, rate-limiting, enterprise monitoring) is not fully implemented.
